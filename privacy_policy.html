                <ul>
                <li><strong>With Agro-Input Suppliers:</strong> If you interact with our Smart Marketplace, we may share relevant information (e.g., your location, crop type, diagnosed issues) with verified agro-dealers and suppliers to facilitate product recommendations and transactions.</li>
                <li><strong>Aggregated and Anonymized Data:</strong> A core component of our service, Mkulima X, involves licensing <strong>aggregated and anonymized datasets</strong> to institutional partners such as government agencies, NGOs, and agri-businesses.

                <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share your information with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as hosting, data storage (e.g., Firebase, Google Cloud), analytics (e.g., Google BigQuery), and telecommunications services (e.g., Twilio).

                <li><strong>Human-in-the-Loop Quality Assurance:</strong> For continuous improvement and accuracy, certain high-risk AI queries or diagnoses may be reviewed by our internal human-in-the-loop quality assurance team or certified agronomists. This is done to improve model performance and ensure the quality of advice, always with a focus on privacy.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court order or government agency).</li>
                <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. Data Security</h2>

                <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction. We use Google's Firebase platform for a managed, serverless backend, including Firestore for our real-time database, and Google Cloud for hosting, which include robust security features. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

                <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>

                <p>We retain your information for as long as necessary to provide our Services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Anonymized data, particularly for Mkulima X, may be retained indefinitely for research and analytical purposes.</p>
